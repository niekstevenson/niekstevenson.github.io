I am a researcher who combines principled statistical methodology with psychological models. My work focuses on Bayesian hierarchical methods that simultaneously account for multiple levels of analysis—from individual level-data to group-level inferences—in decision-making and neuroscience. I specialize in advancing hierarchical modeling techniques, particularly latent variable models, while developing user-friendly software that makes these powerful tools accessible to researchers across disciplines.
